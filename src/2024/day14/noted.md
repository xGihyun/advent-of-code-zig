### Part 1

Pretty simple, we can use some math to calculate the final `x` and `y` positions given the start positions of each robot and the number of steps.

### Part 2

This one was tricky. It was really vague since what kind of Christmas Tree are we looking for? Is it an outline? Is it filled? Is it just a simple triangle? Does it have decorations and stuff?

I looked online and people seemed to have the same questions as I did. After almost 2 hours, I ended up with a naive solution of creating the visualization of the grid and checking if there's a bunch of robots next to each other, and it worked somehow.
I'm not really sure how to optimize this solution, and I don't really have any intentions of doing so. 

This problem is probably the most unique one so far in terms of how it's intented to be solved. I tried to go for the traditional "use an efficient algorithm to solve this" approach, but it gave me headaches instead.
