This one was the easiest problem in a while. 

I initially knew DFS was the way to go in solving this, but I forgot how to implement it since the last time I used it was ~2 years ago when I was still coding in C++, so it was a good problem to refresh my knowledge.

Once you know DFS well, this can be solved with your eyes closed. Although it's quite funny how part 2 can be solved just by commenting some parts of the code.
